Where,
* M is your monthly payment.
* P is your principal.
* r is your monthly interest rate, calculated by dividing your annual interest rate by 12.
* n is your number of payments (the number of months you will be paying the loan)



For example, imagine you have a $12,000 mortgage loan with 6 percent annual interest over 19 years.
* Your input for "P" would be $12,000.
* For "r," you would use your monthly interest rate, which would be 0.06 (6 percent) divided by 12, or 0.005 (0.5 percent).
* For "n" you would use your total number of payments, one for each month in 19 years, which would be 12*19, or 228.
